 I Synthesis are looking for creative data scientists to join our team in Singapore. 

APPLY VIA: https://forms.gle/9kyAzWq1B2AKAhsQ7

We are a team of brand strategists, computer scientists, ethnographers, economists and network theorists. We work with some of the most influential consumer goods companies in Media, Beauty, Fashion, Sports and Travel to build culturally informed, data science-led tools that transform unstructured data into analytical models that solve their business and marketing challenges.

Partnering with the world’s most successful brands in fashion, beauty, content and travel, we’re building specialised solutions to solve problems of planning for the future. Rooted in culture, tested in data science, we spot and anticipate changes and connections in culture to inspire action and help brands grow with a new wave of audiences. After three years of iteratively developing and perfecting these models, we are preparing to launch a series of products over the next 5 years.  

We will be at the forefront of a shift towards leveraging open data to develop rich, honest, human insight. In an industry that has for too long relied on ‘question-response’ approach to understanding changes in behaviour, we prioritise layering behavioural, performative, search and sales data to highlight the discrepancies between what people say they do and what they actually do. We see a $20 billion industry that has failed to innovate for too long and we are just getting started.

This job is for you if...
You are currently Singapore based and are a Singaporean Citizen or PR
You relish the idea of working with data creatively to solve real world business problems
You have 0-3 years experience working with data, and coding experience in R/Python
You are comfortable with uncertainty and open ended challenges
You enjoy working in a fast paced, highly collaborative environment

APPLY VIA: https://forms.gle/9kyAzWq1B2AKAhsQ7

 I THE ROLE.
As a Data Scientist at Synthesis you’ll develop models and analytical frameworks designed for the sharpest insights and marketing professionals in the world, helping them prioritise the issues that matter most to their business and spot where the next big change will come from. We aggregate information from open data sources, advocating for the power of data to solve problems for business and for society as a whole, which means you will be running end-to-end analysis guiding the process from data gathering and cleaning through to processing, modelling and visualisation.

You’ll become an expert in layering datasets to build a complete picture of people’s behaviour, working with search, social, advertising & ecommerce datastreams to name just a few. Ours is a spirit of continuous experimentation and plussing: you’ll always be pushing your ideas in collaboration with a team of experienced data scientists around you. We work in tight-knit project teams, meaning you’ll work side by side with cultural strategists to interpret meaning in the data patterns we see and present your work to our client partners, so you see first-hand the impact your work has.

Requirements
You have a solid understanding of statistical analysis and hands-on experience with one or more of the following programming languages: Java, Python or R.
You have experience in building data visualizations using off the shelf software or packages with R, Python, Gephi, Tableau etc. Familiarity with quick prototyping techniques for data viz work is an advantage.
You are comfortable working with large, complex, unstructured datasets, with a focus on text and image-processing. Natural language processing skills, including topic modelling and semantic parsing, especially for Asian languages and short texts, will be an advantage.
You’re able to communicate your analysis in simple, non-technical terms and relish the prospect of working alongside a team of strategy consultants to move from analysis to implication for business.
You enjoy iteratively developing your ideas, drawing on the value of the diverse experience and perspectives of those around you. You recognise the value of having an array of approaches at your disposal rather than focusing solely on one methodology or model.

Deepen the professional expertise of DSAID’s data scientists by regularly reviewing their technical competencies, identifying and prioritising areas for training, facilitating exchange of ideas and experiences on novel approaches (e.g. new machine learning techniques, new ways to apply existing techniques to different problems), and conducting master-level classes to bring the team up to speed in areas assessed to be most critical for DSAID’s continued professional excellence.
Oversee sourcing, scoping, and execution of data science consultancy projects. This will involve leading brainstorming sessions with the relevant key stakeholders to identify relevant business problems, determine the project scope, iterate on findings, and practising agile methodology in managing the project.
Provide guidance to fellow data scientists on their data science projects. Depending on relative skill level between you and the project team in question, you may be involved in validation of technique / approach used to tackle a specific problem, code review, advise on best practices for model deployment, and/or design of presentation deck to senior management.
Evaluate key trends and research developments in new statistical and machine learning models, and identify areas / opportunities to apply these techniques in projects to grow the capability of the team.

What we are looking for:
An advanced degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, Quantitative Social Science, or related discipline. PhD are preferred. Master’s degree with strong practical experience may also be considered.
At least 8 years of relevant experience in data science, preferably with experience managing a technical team.
Expert-level data science skills in statistical analysis, machine learning and natural language processing
Deep knowledge in model productionisation with skillsets in ML Ops, DevOps or software engineering
Knowledge in data management, data warehousing, data engineering
Have strong analytical, conceptualisation and problem-solving skills. Able to take broad, strategic perspectives, and when necessary, drill deep to understand business needs and challenges.
Experience in developing technical work processes
Excellent oral and written communication skills, along with the ability to pitch ideas and influence stakeholders at all levels on the adoption of analytics. Able to present technical concepts and results of technical analyses to non-technical audience in a concise manner.

ABOUT VIDA 
What are we trying to solve?
We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now.
Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered.
Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs, etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change.

At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone.

Why are we solving this problem? 
The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change. 

Who are we? 
We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns. 

Other things that we care about:
Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously.
We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village.
We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner.
We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other",13
